# Data-Wrangling-Report
Wrangling and Analyzing Data
Introduction
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, we will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it.
This is called data wrangling. We will document the wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, then showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries).
